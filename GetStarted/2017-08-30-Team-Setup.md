## Team Setup

The Team Setup page is a page where Admin coaches can invite other coaches, enable or disable Auto Groups, requets and monitor the status of IT Testing, and schedule training sessions. The team setup page can be accessed from the main menu next to the EduGuide logo or from the sidebar menu inside the Metrics page.
