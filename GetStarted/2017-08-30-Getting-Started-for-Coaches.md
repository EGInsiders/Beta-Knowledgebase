## Getting to Know EduGuide.org

The EduGuide website is a multi-purpose platform which is designed to meet the needs of both students and teachers. After joining the team, students will complete activities on a regular basis while coach use the system to respond to students' comments, monitor group progress, and collaborate on their fellow coaches from within the team.

### Site Structure

EduGuide.org is broken up into two main areas which are accessible from the site wide navigation menu next to the logo: Your personal profile and account, and Teams. From your personal profile area, you can post a message on your personal dashboard, manage your account settings, or manage your personal goals. Each team contains a team dashboard, library, goals page, Metrics, and member management.

### Roles

There are two main roles on the site: Coaches and Members. Typically anybody who will be mentoring students will join their team as a coach and will have access to all of EduGuide's features. Students are designated as members on the site, do not see the team pages, and can only interact with coaches via their personal path.
