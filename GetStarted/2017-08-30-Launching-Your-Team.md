## Launching Your Team

After EduGuide receives your organization's  P.O. order, an email will be sent inviting your team to get started with the process of setting up your team and getting students started on their path. The initial coaches who join the team will be automatically be taken to the setup page and prompted to invite other coaches, designate a captain, request an IT test, and schedule training. Everyone who joins your team will also be taken their their professional development path.
