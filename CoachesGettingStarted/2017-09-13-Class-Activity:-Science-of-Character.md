**Class Activity: Science of Character**

Directions: Use the video, Science of Character, from the website Let It Ripple and this document as a guide to lead students through an introduction to the EduGuide program. Pair it with About EduGuide, so students have clear expectations and are ready to begin.

Students will examine various elements and areas of character study, as well as ways in which learning these key Core Learning Skills helps us to not only achieve personal academic goals, but also helps later on in life with career and relationships. Identifying ways character strengths create an integrated identity and ultimately relationships. Further the discussion by watching the video together and sharing in a group discussion. Review these concepts at the start of the program to get the conversation going and give students a better idea of what they will be working on this year through their own personal path of exploration, online with EduGuide.

**Questions for Exploration**

1. What are your strengths? Which strengths would you like to continue to develop?

2. How could building on your strengths create a better space for learning? 

3. How do you think EduGuide could help build on your strengths?

4. How does your attitude help shape your learning environment?

5. What kind of traits do you want your teachers to have? Why?

6. What kind of example do you want to set for other students at your school?

7. What are some ways you can help others learn about their own strengths?

**Questions for Further Discussion**

1. How can these skills help you achieve academically? In life? In relationships?

2. Which are your weaker areas? How could you improve on these?

3. Think of someone you admire. What are their 3 strengths?

4. Brainstorm together as a class or in small groups: What are some of the ways in which character intersects with education, culture, work, faith, citizenship, science, art, philosophy, and politics?
