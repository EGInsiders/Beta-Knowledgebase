# Personal Settings

Both students and coaches are able to adjust their account personal settings from their "My Settings" page. This page is accessible from the main navigation.

Here are some things you can do from your My Settings page:

## Change your Photo

Click on "Change Photo" to open up a file chooser which you can use to select and upload a new image for your account avatar. Once you upload the new image, it will be displayed on the settings page.

## Change Password

Clicking "Change Password" will open up a field where you can upload your account's password. You will be asked to enter in your password, and then your new password. Click “Change Password” to save the changes.

## Change Profile

You can change your account, email address, username, and cell phone number by clicking on the "Change Profile" link. A form will appear when you click the link. Enter changes and your password, then click “update.”

## Email Notifications

The last section on the My Settings page displays a list of options which you can enable or disable for your personal notifications. You can use this section to switch notifications on or off for personal notifications, dashboard notifications, path comments and reminders, and the path email reports.
