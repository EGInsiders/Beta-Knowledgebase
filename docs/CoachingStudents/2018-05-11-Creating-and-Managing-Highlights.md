* **Coach Tip:** This is a handy tool for you to use while reviewing students' comments on the Metrics page.

* **Student Tip:** You can save a quote or copies of your comments to your list of highlights as you are completing activities in the path.

While working on your Path, you may come across something interesting or important that you want to flag for future reference. You have the ability to save text by using the Highlights feature. You can save a comment, a quote, or an excerpt from your **Path**.

 

The Highlights feature can be used in both the **Metrics view**, the **View all Replies** page and within the **Path** itself.

You can see your saved **Highlights** by viewing them on your personal **Highlights** page.

To access the **Highlights** tool, click on the main navigation menu in the top left hand corner of your screen.

When you create the highlight, only the mutual teams will be shown.
