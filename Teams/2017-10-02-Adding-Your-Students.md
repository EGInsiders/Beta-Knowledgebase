## Adding Your Students

Membership on the site is managed through the use of join codes. When you are ready to add new students to your team you can give them the join code or join URL which are shown for your group.

### Locate your group's Join Code

From the Group Management page, click on "Invite Members" next to the group you would like your students to join. You will be taken to a page which displays the invitation code for that group.

### Copy the Join code for the group

The invitation page will offer different ways to add students to the group. You can copy either the code or the URL to your clipboard so that you can share the information.

### Instruct your Students to join the team

Ask your students to join the team by first going to [http://join.eduguide.org](http://join.eduguide.org) and then completing a registration form. The last field on the form will ask for the join code, which you can provide to them either in a handout or by writing it on the board. If you choose to use the join URL, the students will be directed to a registration form with the join code already filled in.

When your student registers on your team, they will be automatically added to the team and your group as a member.  Next, they will be routed to a page which prompts them to customize their avatar and then to the first activity in the path.
