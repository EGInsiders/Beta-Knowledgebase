Team Settings and Onboarding Updates

# Overview

The updates which are being introduced to the Team Settings/Team Setup Page and to the team onboarding process will help to streamline users' experience. The feature changes include:

* **Vertical instead of a horizontal approach for the Team Setup** - All steps are displayed on a single page instead on several pages such as with our older, wizard-like approach. A status bar and counter will help to illustrate when the coach has completed all of the needed steps. Admin Coaches will be routed to this page until all steps are completed.

* **Team submenus in the Main Navigation** - Coaches can jump to any team page by clicking on their team's name once in the main navigation once to expand a list of options, and then clicking on a destination.

# Launching a Partner Team

This step remains the same. Click on the  "Admin" menu towards the bottom of the navigation menu, and then click on “Create Partner Team.” You will be guided through a series of screens which will prompt you for set up information for the team. At the end, you will be prompted for the email address of the person who you would like to initiate the launch of the team.

# Super Admin Coach completes team setup

As usual, the very first admin coach will respond to the invitation to launch their team, register on the site, join the team, and then begin the process of completing the steps inside the team setup page. They have the option of skipping a step on the page. The site will continue to route admin coaches to the team setup page until all steps are marked complete.

# Sending Invitations

## Functionality

Within each section where you send invitations to IT Technicians, Captains, and coaches, you still have the ability to enter, manage, and remove email addresses or pending invitations. You can also trigger invitation reminders by clicking "Send Reminders."

Two key differences in the interface is that each section will include a note indicating the name of the last person who made modifications. Also, for the Team Captain and the Coach invitations, as you are finalizing the invitation via the modal which will pop up, you have the option of entering a Student Start Date. This date will be included in the corresponding invitations.

## IT Testing

Not too much has changed for the IT Testing process. We have enhanced the questionaire at the end which asks the IT Tester if the test passed or failed.
